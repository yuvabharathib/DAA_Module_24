# EX 6A CHERRY PICK UP PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To Create a python program for the following problem statement.
You are given an n x n grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.
0	means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
1	means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.
Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below:
Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (n - 1, n - 1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1).
After reaching (n - 1, n - 1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells.
When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell 0. If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1), then no cherries can be collected.



## Algorithm
1. Use a 3D DP table dp[x1][y1][x2] to store the maximum cherries collected when two players move from (0,0) to (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), where y2 = x1 + y1 - x2 
2. If either player goes out of bounds or hits a thorn (-1), return -∞ (invalid path). If both are at (0,0), return grid[0][0].
3. Try all four possible moves (player1 and player2 each move either up or left), and take the max result.
4. Collect cherries from both positions (only once if both are at the same cell).
5. Start recursion from bottom-right corner (n-1,n-1) for both players and return max(0, result) to handle case where no valid path exists.

## Result:
Thus the above program was executed successfully for finding the maximum number of cherries from grid.
